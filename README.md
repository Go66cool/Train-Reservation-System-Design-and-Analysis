# Database Design and Analysis for a Train Reservation System

In this project, we will be focusing on the creation and evaluation of a database for a train reservation system. The documentation will comprehensively outline the steps taken throughout the project.

The design will encompass various aspects, including tickets, trains, passengers, services associated with ticket classes, seats, dates, arrival times, station movements, and more.

Our methodology involves designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and then transforming it into a schema. We will be utilizing the ERDPlus.com website for this purpose. Subsequently, we will employ SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) commands to create the necessary tables and SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands to populate the database with relevant data.

A significant portion of the project will revolve around crafting SQL queries. These queries will serve to generate reports, perform data analysis to meet the business requirements, and provide deeper insights into the various entities within the system.

Throughout this project, we will work with diverse database systems, including SQL Live, Oracle, and MS SQL Server, to ensure the database is versatile and can cater to different platforms and requirements.
